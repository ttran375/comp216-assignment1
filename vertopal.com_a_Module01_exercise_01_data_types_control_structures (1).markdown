##Instructions

1.  Complete the exercises as far as you possibly can

2.  Rename the workbook to your first name\

3.  Make sure that the notebook is shareable

4.  Upload a link to the Assessment folder in brightspace\

5.  ## You code must work even if the original variable changes

    If you leave the notebook and/or start working at mid-way in the
    notebook, you will have to execute the first cell again to re-load
    the variable etc.
